# TheUltimateSimonGame
Just a simple project to practice my skill in html/css/js/jquery/bootstrap. It consist in the typical Simon Game that we all know. You have to see the pattern in order to follow the same sequence. 

#Version #1
The number of steps until win have been set previosly. There are a few bugs to solve, mostly animation bugs.
For programers: You only have to change two parameters to change the number of steps manually, you see those in the previous commit (has been changed 4 to 5 steps).
